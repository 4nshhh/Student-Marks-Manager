# Build a command-line Python application to store, view, search, and analyze student marks. The student data should be saved persistently in a CSV file so that itâ€™s retained even after the program closes.

# Objective:
# Create a CLI-based system that allows users (e.g., a teacher or student) to:
# Add new student records
# View all student records
# Search for a specific student
# Analyze marks (average, highest, lowest)
# Delete a student record
# Exit the application safely
